* [NEW] Users with the right permission can configure the modules that will be 
  displayed in the left/right columns and the order in which modules will 
  appear. This can be used to let users configure their modules as they want,
  as an admin you must make all the modules that the users can configure 
  available by default. 
* [NEW] Statistics, a page where you (or anyone with permission) can view a lot 
  of statistics about the site including a graph showing the number of 
  pageviews per day. Statistics can be enabled/disabled from the admin screen, 
  please suggest new (useful) statistics that can be added in future versions

  textfile, the {cookie} syntax can be used to display a random cookie in 
  articles, posts, wiki pages,etc or any template.

  additional game-pack. You can upload new games, edit the descriptions and

  versions won't be able to undo what other users edited only his editions can
  be undone.
* [NEW] Individual permissions for CMS topics added, you can now control who 
  can read some topics, if the topic has no individual permissions then it will

  tiki_p_read_topic permission to some groups for a topic and only those groups 
  will be able to read that topic.

Version 1.2 -Antares-

* [THANKS] Special thanks to AlBrown,MarcLaporte,Yakumo,Ramiro,Tom,Tesla2k and 
  others ! for submitting many bugs that are now fixed and for suggesting many 
  features that are now implemented. If some feature is not yet included don't 
  worry it will be addressed in a future version. Thanks!
* [FIX] Fixed a bug when adding new topics  
* [NEW] Added a find feature to the lastchanges section in the Wiki (Ramiro)
* [NEW] Categories: You can create categories and subcategories building a 
  category tree, objects (pages, forums, blogs, image galleries, file 
  galleries, etc) can be assigned to one/many categories, the user can browse
  categories finding objects for each specific category.
* [NEW] Communication center: Now you can send/receive Wiki pages from/to other 
  Tiki-enabled sites using a simple XMLRPC API, received pages are stored in an 
  "inbox" where an admin can view,edit,remove,accept the pages.  This new 
  feature can be used to send a Tiki page from one site to another one!   
* [NEW] Consolidated CSS file, there're two CSS files in this distribution: 
  subSilver and default2, if you want to produce a new theme you can change any 
  of these, subSilver is longer and uses an individual style for every element 
  in Tiki while default2 applies the same style to multiple elements (ie: 
  tables) and thus is a faster way to get a theme ready.
* [FIXED] Fixed bugs in the registration screen and now the username is 
  validated.
* [NEW] Forums!, now you can set-up mesage forums, forums are organized by 
  topics and topics by threads, users can post, reply and quote messages in 
  forums, messages can be voted using the same karma system used in comments. 
  Many features are "copied" from phpBB since it is the best forum software for 
  PHP, we copied those features and integrated the forums with the Tiki 
  permission system, rankings, modules and search engine. There's a lot about 
  forums so I guess it's best to stop the description here, the documentation 
  will introduce all the features in forums.
* [NEW] Now you can upload the thumbnail of an image when uploading an image, 
  this will prevent automatic thumbnail generation. Some users wanted this 
  feature because thumbnail generation didn't work or they wanted to upload 
  their own thumbnails. Maybe you want to have a thumbnail that is not the same 
  as the full image so you can use this feature. Thumbnails will be displayed 
  using the size assignated for thumbnails to the image gallery.   
* [NEW] Now you can set up how old must a version be at least to be removed 
  from the history, this can prevent a user from saving a page "n" times 
  destroying a previous version. (Thanks to tesla2k for the tip)
* [NEW] Links to help including objects in user modules where added to the 
  admin_modules screen.
