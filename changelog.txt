Version 1.2 -Antares-


* [THANKS] Special thanks to AlBrown,MarcLaporte,Yakumo,Ramiro,Tom,Tesla2k and others ! for submitting many bugs 
  that  are now fixed and for suggesting many features that are now implemented. If some feature is not yet
  included don't worry it will be addressed in a future version. Thanks!
* [FIX] Fixed a bug when adding new topics  
* [NEW] Added a find feature to the lastchanges section in the Wiki (Ramiro)
* [NEW] Categories: You can create categories and subcategories building a category tree, objects (pages, forums,
  blogs, image galleries, file galleries, etc) can be assigned to one/many categories, the user can browse
  categories finding objects for each specific category.
* [NEW] Communication center: Now you can send/receive Wiki pages from/to other Tiki-enabled sites using a simple
  XMLRPC API, received pages are stored in an "ibox" where an admin can view,edit,remove,accept the pages. 
  This new feature can be used to send a Tiki page from one site to another one!   
* [NEW] Consolidated CSS file, there're two CSS files in this distribution: subSilver and default2, if you want
  to produce a new theme you can change any of these, subSilver is longer and uses an individual style for every
  element in Tiki while default2 applies the same style to multiple elements (ie: tables) and thus is a faster
  way to get a theme ready.
* [FIXED] Fixed bugs in the registration screen and now the username is validated.
* [NEW] Forums!, now you can set-up mesage forums, forums are organized by topics and topics by threads, users
  can post, reply and quote messages in forums, messages can be voted using the same karma system used in
  comments. Many features are "copied" from phpBB since it is the best forum software for PHP, we copied those
  features and integrated the forums with the Tiki permission system, rankings, modules and search engine.
  There's a lot about forums so I guess it's best to stop the description here, the documentation will introduce
  all the features in forums.
* [NEW] Now you can upload the thumbnail of an image when uploading an image, this will prevent automatic
  thumbnail generation. Some users wanted this feature because thumbnail generation didn't work or they
  wanted to upload their own thumbnails. Maybe you want to have a thumbnail that is not the same as the
  full image so you can use this feature. Thumbnails will be displayed using the size assignated for thumbnails
  to the image gallery.   
* [NEW] Now you can set up how old must a version be at least to be removed from the history, this can prevent
  a user from saving a page "n" times destroying a previous version. (Thanks to tesla2k for the tip)

  also included.
