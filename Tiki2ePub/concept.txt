The concept here is to create a script that will allow <TikiAdmin> to publish 
	a nominated Tiki Structure ready for compilation as an ePub.
	
I'm using Rick Sapir's "Tiki for Smarties" (http://twbasics.keycontent.org) as 
	my base Tiki, in order to have a fully structured Tiki for testing.
	Rick uses Categories which differentiate between Tiki versions on some pages
	... this parser should also be able to read Categories.
	
Upon creation of the static documents, an Archive should be created ready for 
	downloading and importing into Sigil.   http://code.google.com/p/sigil/
	
Why Sigil specifically?
	Because it's free :) ... and super easy to use.

Possible complications:	
	Sigil (0.4.2) uses XHTML 1.1 pages, not HTML5
		We will need to replicate some of the HTML5 tags as CSS <span> classes 
			to counteract those invalid tags in XHTML 1.1
	At this time, ePubs don't support media content, rumour has it the next 
		version of the specs will support it, we need to allow for support 
		later.
		
		Write the script to wrap any media elements in comments, making them 
			invisible to Sigil .... the comments can be easily removed once the
			ePub specs allow for interactive content.
	
	Javascript elements don't seem to work properly in ePubs
		For the time being, either recreate them as static objects or omit them 
			from the document flow
	
	We only need the page content, not the layout
		When pulling content, we could use javascript to extract the inner-html.
		This could be overcome be simply bypassing the usual templates used and
		droping the Wiki directly into our ePub template ... not sure, need to 
		test.

The Archive Structure:
	<ePubNm>/structure.txt	--	copy of the document structure so we can add 
								our pages to Sigil in correct order.
								This is already accomplished in Tiki via
								tiki-admin_structures.php?export_tree=1,
								although if we want to get fancy and hyperlink 
								the pages, we could write a script to return 
								linkage.

	<ePubNm>/images.txt		--	a (reference) list of images used 
								
	<ePubNm>/Text			--	our cached XHTML pages.

	<ePubNm>/Images			--	all images used need to be copied accross to 
								here so they are visible to Sigil.

	<ePubNm>/Styles 	    --	any CSS used, strongly recommended that a 
								specific CSS page be created for the book.

	<ePubNm>/Misc			--	suggested location for our Smarty Template, 
								"ePubPage.tpl"
