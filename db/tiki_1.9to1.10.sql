# The following script will update a tiki database from verion 1.9 to 1.10
# 
# To execute this file do the following:
#
# $ mysql -f dbname < tiki_1.9to1.10.sql
#
# where dbname is the name of your tiki database.
#
# For example, if your tiki database is named tiki (not a bad choice), type:
#
# $ mysql -f tiki < tiki_1.9to1.10.sql
# 
# You may execute this command as often as you like, 
# and may safely ignore any error messages that appear.
