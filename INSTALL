INSTALL TIKI WITH POSTGRESQL
----------------------------
refer to http://tikiwiki.org/TikiPostgres
 

INSTALL TIKI WITH MYSQL
-----------------------
Before you get started it's a good idea to know:

    * your database user name and password
    * your apache user and group ID 


If you're using the rpm that is available you can skip down to browser based install.

These are notes on how to setup and configure Tiki.

Step one:
- - - - - - 
Unpack and set the necessary permissions
unpack to the document root of where you want tiki installed, e.g. /var/www/tiki/ 

bz2 file Use:
tar xjf tikiwiki-1.8.2.tar.bz2

Step two:
- - - - - - -
CHMOD the file setup.sh to 755. "chmod 755 setup.sh"

* Set permissions and virtual host domains with setup.sh:
  o Determine what user and group your webserver runs as 

The script setup.sh in this directory assigns necessary permissions for the directories that the
webserver writes files to. It also creates the (initially empty) cache directories.

Usage: ./setup.sh user group rights list of virtual host domains

For example, if apache is running as user $AUSER and group $AGROUP, type:
You can find your group using the command 'id'.

su -c './setup.sh $AUSER'

Alternatively, you may wish to set both the user and group:
If not root then
su -c './setup.sh $USER $AGROUP'

This will allow you to delete certain files/directories without becoming root. Or, if you can't become
root, but are a member of the group apache runs under (for example: $AGROUP), you can type:

./setup.sh $USER $AGROUP

If root then, and are not a member of the apache group, then type:
./setup.sh $USER yourgroup 02777

Replace yourgroup with your default group.

NOTE: If you do execute this last command, you will not be able to delete certain files created by
apache, and will need to ask your system administrator to delete them for you if needed.

To use Tiki's multi-site capability (virtual hosts from a single DocumentRoot) add a list of domains to
the command to create all the needed directories. For example

If Root then
root@localhost tiki]# sh ./setup.sh youruser nobody 02775 test1 test2 test3

If not Root then
./setup.sh $USER $AGROUP 02777 domain1 domain2 domain3

This will get you to the next screen go to step three below.

Step three: browser based setup
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
* create a tiki database
  - often using PhpMyAdmin (cache) and MySQL
  - or on the command line mysqladmin create dbname
    the database name is usually called "tiki" 
* Point your browser to the web address that corresponds to the file tiki-install.php (e.g.
  http://localhost/tiki/tiki-install.php)
* Follow the instructions there
  you'll need the password and user name for your database 
* For the first time to log into Tiki is 

user: admin
password: admin

Step four: Custom configuration
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Next you can configure Tiki to your needs:

* Choose which features you want switched on
  - click on http://localhost/tiki/tiki-admin.php on the left side of your screen 
* (Optionally) create groups of users that share permissions
* Assign appropriate permissions 

Good luck!
