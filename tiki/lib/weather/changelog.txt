and Last Updated by boinger <boinger@fuck-you.org> http://fuck-you.org/ (no joke!)


2003.07.23 - Weather 2.8 released
- Weather.com changed the url for fetching weather data... again...
- the webcell include was moved outside the class, so that calling it multiple
times doesn't result in an error (duh)


2003.05.23 - Weather 2.7 released
- Weather.com changed the url for fetching weather data. Small update to
fix this.
- A couple fixes to sample.php as pointed out by a few people :-)


2003.02.06 - Weather 2.5 released
- Fix to getFeelsLike, which was not properly reporting the "feels like"
temperature. Thanks to Fred Damstra for pointing this out!


2003.01.09 - Weather 2.4 released
- Weather.com changed their site format again - more major this time. (WebCell
is really getting handy :-) ) This update is required to parse the new format.


2002.11.23 - Weather 2.3 released
- Weather.com changed their site format. This update is required to parse the
new format.


2002.07.25 - Weather 2.21 released
- Weather.com moved some files around. Just had to update the URL in the 
Weather.php class.
- Removed the Warning error report from WebCell, just because it was annoying
and wasn't necessary.


2002.07.04 - Weather 2.2 released
- this version uses a hacked version of WebCell and performs some data manipulation 
in order to try and make it more robust (the Weather.com site is changing too 
rapidly - this is an attempt to parse the code more reliably)
- due to the above I was able to recombine the 2 scripts (from version 2.1) back 
into a single script. 


2002.06.06 - Weather 2.1 released
- split into two versions, an American one and an International one
- removed debug by default (accidently left on in last version)


2002.04.29 - Weather 2.0 released
- now uses WebCell to retrieve and parse much of the data, making it much easier to
update to Weather.com's changing site formats. You must have a copy of WebCell in
the directory with Weather. 
- WebCell includes integrated caching functions. See Weather's creator function for
information on how to use these with Weather
- now returns proper variable types. eg: getTemp returns an integer, instead of a
string
- function getFeelsLike added - general updates to make it work with Weather.com's
new site format


2000.12.15 - Weather 0.5 beta released
