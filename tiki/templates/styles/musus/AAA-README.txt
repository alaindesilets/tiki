Hi,
This theme is under HEAVY revision.  Many features in Tiki currently don't work when using this theme.  If you update your public site from cvs, please delete this folder & the "musus.css" file from the $tikiroot/styles/ directory.

NOTICE:
This theme is NOT intended for a production environment.  It is NOT ready for use.  If you would like to join in the "musus theme team" let me know.  Thanks.
