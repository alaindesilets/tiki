Tiki Copyright
----------------
$Header: /cvsroot/tikiwiki/tiki/copyright.txt,v 1.3 2003-10-20 09:27:52 mose Exp $

The following list gathers the copyrights holders for tikiwiki 
at the state of 1.7 version. Each member of that list wrote at 
least one line, directly or indirectly, in tikiwiki code source. 
The exact proportion of the contribution of each is not an issue, 
as any copyright change will involve the agreement of everybody. 

This is how we implement the TikiWikiSocialContract.

List of members of the Community

If you are not on that list and are member of the tikiwiki community,
please contact an admin to be added. Operation is manual for now,
working on its automatisation ..

That list is accessible on http://tikiwiki.org/whois for members only
(soon public, the time to sort private from public data).
