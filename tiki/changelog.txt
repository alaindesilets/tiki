  tables) and thus is a faster way to get a theme ready.

  topics and topics by threads, users can post, reply and quote messages in

  PHP, we copied those features and integrated the forums with the Tiki 
  permission system, rankings, modules and search engine. There's a lot about 
  forums so I guess it's best to stop the description here, the documentation 
  will introduce all the features in forums.
* [NEW] Now you can upload the thumbnail of an image when uploading an image, 
  this will prevent automatic thumbnail generation. Some users wanted this 
  feature because thumbnail generation didn't work or they wanted to upload 
  their own thumbnails. Maybe you want to have a thumbnail that is not the same 
  as the full image so you can use this feature. Thumbnails will be displayed 
  using the size assignated for thumbnails to the image gallery.

  from the history, this can prevent a user from saving a page "n" times
