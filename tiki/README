This directory contains source code to 

    Tiki! The wiki with lot of features!

You will need to set the proper directory ownership permissions before
you can use tiki.

To set the rights, type:

su -c './setup.sh <user>'

where <user> is the user the web server runs as.

In most cases, this will be 'nobody':

su -c './setup.sh nobody'

In Debian, it is usually 'www-data'.

For security, or other purposes, you may wish the set the user *and* group.
To do this, type:

su -c './setup.sh <user> <group>'

For example:

su -c './setup.sh mylogin www-data'
