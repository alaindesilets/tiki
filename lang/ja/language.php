<?php // -*- coding:utf-8 -*-
// parameters:
// lang=xx    : only tranlates language 'xx',
//              if not given all languages are translated
// comments   : generate all comments (equal to close&module)
// close      : look for similar strings that are allready translated and
//              generate a commet if a 'match' is made
// module     : generate comments that describes in which .php and/or .tpl
//              module(s) a certain string was found (useful for checking
//              translations in context)
// patch      : looks for the file 'language.patch' in the same directory
//              as the corresponding language.php and overrides any strings
//              in language.php - good if a user does not agree with
//              some translations or if only changes are sent to the maintaner
// spelling   : generates a file 'spellcheck_me.txt' that contains the
//              words used in the translation.It is then easy to check this
//              file for spelling errors (corrections must be done in
 //              'language.php, however)
// groupwrite : Sets the generated files permissions to allow the generated
//              language.php also be group writable. This is good for
//              translators if they do not have root access to tiki but
//              are in the same group as the webserver. Please remember
//              to have write access removed when translation is finished
//              for security reasons. (Run script again without this
//              parameter)
// Examples:
// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv
// Will translate langauage 'sv' and (almost) avoiding comment generation

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv&comments
// Will translate langauage 'sv' and generate all possible comments.
// This is the most usefull mode when working on a translation.

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?lang=sv&nohelp&nosections
// These options will only provide the minimal amout of comments.
// Usefull mode when preparing a translation for distribution.

// http://www.neonchart.com/get_strings.php?nohelp&nosections
// Prepare all languages for release
