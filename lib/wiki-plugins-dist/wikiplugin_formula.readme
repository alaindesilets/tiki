This plugin renders mathematical formulas in wiki pages. The formulas should
be written in LaTeX format, simple ones will be in plain html and complex ones
will render a graphic.

This plugin requires latex installed, or at least path-accesible installed 
latex, dvips, and Imagemagic's convert. It uses the bash script tex2png
that initially should be in the lib directory of the Tikiwiki installation.

To enable it, it should be copied to the wiki-plugin directory.
