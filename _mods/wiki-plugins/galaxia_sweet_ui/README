 Galaxia Sweet UI set of wiki plugins
-------------------------------------

This package provides a set of wiki plugins that allow Galaxia workflow developers to make user interfaces that abstract galaxia concepts from final user. So, user will run the activities from the wiki pages and don't have to know what's an instance, activity or proccess, they just click and go through application.

Documentation of plugin usage is still missing, here are a list of plugins and what they do.

FILES

* lib/wiki-plugins/wikiplugin_galaxiainstances.php

This plugin lists all instances of a given activity that can be executed by current user

* lib/wiki-plugins/wikiplugin_galaxiamultiroute.php

This lists all instances of a given SWITCH activity that can be executed by current user, and
provides an interface for the user to select the destination of each instance, all at once.

So, this is useful if you have a point where one human user will just decide where an instance
should go, without modifying it. Later this plugin should allow user to put comments in an instance,
or execute instance instead of just routing.

Internally, galaxiamultiroute just check where user has chosen to send instance, call setNextActivity()
and complete().

* lib/wiki-plugins/wikiplugin_galaxiasequence.php

This allows user to execute an activity, and after activity is completed next interactive activity is 
executed in sequence, until user can't execute it anymore. At this point, a chosen message (defined by
plugin data) is shown to user.

* lib/wiki-plugins/wikiplugin_galaxiastandalone.php

This just allows user to run an standalone activity inside a wiki page.

* lib/wiki-plugins/galaxia_plugins_common.php

This file provides a custom galaxia_execute_activity function. This function is supposed to 
work fine for any activity execution and could substitute the on in Galaxia's config.tikiwiki.php,
but it's not yet enough tested. It was written for Galaxia Sweet UI set of wiki plugins because
in my server I can't make subrequests via https, so I copied code from tiki-g_run_activity.php
to make it run in same request and by redirecting user.
