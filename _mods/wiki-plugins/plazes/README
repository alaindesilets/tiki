PLAZES wiki-plugin
===================

This plug is used with the super cool www.plazes.com to show your current connection location.

You'll need an account on plazes and to be running the Desktop Launcher for it to work correctly.

You will need your plazes Key, and option map = 0 / 1 to show your location map or not.
