TikiWiki User Contributed Templates Collection
-------------------------------------------

These templates are bundled seperately and offer alternative layouts to the
default TikiWiki templates.
Also, you may want to license your template differently.

If no license reference is found in your themes README, lets assume its 
the same as TikiWiki, thats LGPL.

Remember to include your contact details.

Please note the following desired format:

/templategroup/README

/templategroup/templates/
* This contains everything that needs to be copied to your sites /templates/ 
  folder or even better /templates/styles/theme/.

The idea being you can just cp -R /templategroup* /tikiroot/....../
