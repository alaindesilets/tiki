Kuro theme
==========

A mash-up of several existing themes, with a revogear.com look
See http://tikiwiki.org/StylesKuro for more details

Please feel free to discuss improvements to this theme at the URL above
or on <irc://irc.freenode.net/#tikiwiki>

Please do not use this theme as a basis for your own - simple.css,
tikineat.css, codex.css and classicblue.css are much better templates
and are much more likely to work with different versions of Tiki.
