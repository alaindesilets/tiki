Clock Module
=================

Very cool little javascript ticking clock to sit in your left or right column
without a module frame as well for added coolness, or with world mode displays a large analog and digital world clock in border

Params are:
  mode: default | world
     default: damian's 1-row and status bar version
     world - an anlog and digital world clock (doesn't support DST)

Enjoy :)
