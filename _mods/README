TikiWiki mods Collection
-------------------------

These packages are bundled separately because they may contain various 
licences. Each mod may have its own, refer to them specifically before 
using them.

A package is a file 

* <type-packagename>.info.txt
	
	It holds meta-information about the package, following simple rules :
	
	- Each meta-information is separated by a double linefeed 
		(2 or more, actually).
	
	- Each meta-information uses its first line to state the label, 
		stripping the final column if there is one
	
	- further lines after first one are the value of the label, 
		using one or more lines
	
	- any line beginning with a # will be silently ignored.

	- label order don't matter
	
	- label values will be trimed off extra whitespaces
	
	- you can add arbitrary optional labels if you need
	
	- mandatory labels are :
		
		- revision : incremental revision number
		
		- description : a single sentence stating what is that package for.
		
		- licence : the exact licence, or 'unknown'
	
	
	- optional labels are :
		
		- files : one line per file, separated with destination with a space
			that list will be used to install the files and to remove them
		
		- help : a verbose explaination of what that package is supposed to perform
		
		- urls : one or more urls (one per line, separated by space, followed by optional label)
		
		- changelog : list of modification, one line per revision, 
			revision number being the first word on each line. 
			Multiple lines with same revision number is fine.
		
		- version : the tiki version required for use of the package
		
		- sql-install : each line will be executed in sql at install
		
		- sql-remove : each line will be executed at removal
		
		- configuration : each line is a defined variable necessary in the install script
		
		- php-install : name of the php scripts to call before install
		
		- php-remove : name of the scripts to call after remove


* a set of files in arbitrary locations, as listed in the <type-packagename>.info.txt file


Revisions numbers :

Each time something relevant is changed in any package file, the revision 
number has to be incremented. The use of the changelog field is good for that.


Note about licence :

If no license is showing, we shall asume it's possibly proprietary, stated 
under 'unknown'. You should only use those package for test or private use.
If you run a public service, we advise you don't use those packages except 
if you manage the licence agreement with the proper copyrighter.
