Description:
Batch to load a list of pages from a csv file containing the list of pages with (name, hits, data, lastModif, comment, user, ip, description,lang,category) info

2 params to the script : file=file_name and max=max_line_length ( for php5.0.4 max is mandatory and not null). The file must be a csv file and must contain all or some of the fields: name, hits, data, lastModif, comment, user, ip, description,lang,category. A cvs file has a first line describing the fields separated by comma, and each next line is a data with the values of the fields separated by comma ( if a value has a comma put the value between double-quotes and if it has double-quote, double the double-quotes. The page is only created if it does not exist. The category must exist. The category can be added to an already existing page
